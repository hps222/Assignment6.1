1. Use the given link and locate the bank marketing dataset. Data Set Link:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing
Perform the below operations:


a. Create a visual for representing missing values in the dataset.

bank_full <- read.csv("D:/R/bank-full.csv", header=TRUE, sep=";")
str(bank_full)

require(Amelia)
missmap(bank_full,main="Missing Data - Bank ", 
	col=c("red","grey"),legend=FALSE)
summary(bank_full)

## No red colour stripes are visible. hence no missing values.




b. Show a distribution of clients based on a Job.

bank_full <- read.csv("D:/R/bank-full.csv", header= TRUE, sep = ";")
bank_full_1 <- table(bank_full$job)

# Distribution in tabular form
bank_full_1

# visual representation of distribution
barplot(bank_full_1,xlab="Job",ylab = "Frequency", main = "Clients based on Job", border="black", 
                 col=heat.colors(15),las=3)




c. Check whether is there any relation between Job and Marital Status?

As both are a categorical variable this can be checked with chisq.test 

bank_full <- read.csv("D:/R/bank-full.csv", header=TRUE, sep=";")

library("MASS")
with(bank_full, chisq.test( job, marital))

# Result

Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  job and marital
X-squared = 3837.6, df = 22, p-value < 2.2e-16


# <2.2e-16 means 0.00000000000000022. It is (very much) less than 0.05, there is relation between Job and Marital Status.




d. Check whether is there any association between Job and Education?

As both are a categorical variable this can be checked with chisq.test 

bank_full <- read.csv("D:/R/bank-full.csv", header=TRUE, sep=";")

library("MASS")
with(bank_full, chisq.test( job,education))

# Result

Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  job and education
X-squared = 28483, df = 33, p-value < 2.2e-16

# <2.2e-16 means 0.00000000000000022. It is (very much) less than 0.05, there is relation between Job and Education.
